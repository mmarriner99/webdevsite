<h2>Church of our Lady</h2>
<p>The Church of Our Lady, Seaton, is the Parish Church of the Parish of Delaval. The Church was built about the end of the 11th Century by Guy de Laval, the nephew, by marriage, of William the Conqueror, and consecrated in 1102 by Bishop Flambard of Durham.
<hr>
The Nave is separate from the Chancel by two fine Norman arches, which is quite rare in such a small building. A blocked Saxon window, visible on the outside of the North wall of the Nave, suggests an even earlier building. On the Nave walls and the West wall hang six funeral Hatchments (Coats of Arms), of which there are only 50 in the whole of Northumberland.
<hr>
For over 700 years the Church remained the private chapel of the Delaval family and their retainers. On the death, in 1814, of the last male Delaval the estate passed, by marriage, to a Norfolk family, the descendants of Sir Thomas de Astley. Sir Jacob Henry Astley of Kings Lynn, inherited the property. In 1817 it passed to his son, Jacob, who revived the family title of Baron Hastings in 1841. In 1891 the grandfather of the late Lord Hastings presented the building to the Church of England for ever as the Parish Church of the Parish of Delaval.
<hr>
The Friends of the Church of Our Lady open the church to visitors (see opening times below) and look after Our Lady for the Parish, raising funds to help with maintenance and running costs. If you'd like to become a Friend and support this remarkable Grade 1 listed heritage gem you can contact us directly at Friendsofthechurchofourlady@secretary.net or on Facebook. Annual Membership is Â£6 per person.
<hr>
If you are looking for a worthwhile and rewarding way to spend a few hours meeting new people  why not consider becoming a Guide or Greeter. You don't have to memorise any facts and you'll be able to shadow another Guide until you find your feet. You can volunteer for as many hours as suits you.
<hr>
Contact us at <a href="mailto:Friendsofthechurchofourlady@secretary.net">Friendsofthechurchofourlady@secretary.net</a> or Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fotcool" class="website_link">https://www.facebook.com/fotcool</a> or on 0191 237 1136.
<hr>
The Church is open at weekends from 1-4pm.  Please check back to this page for updates on weekday openings during the summer. Although many visitors come to us while they are visiting our neighbour Seaton Delaval Hall, you don't have to be a member of the National Trust and you can also come up the church path from the road at Dicky Bird Corner on The Avenue. You'll receive a warm welcome.
